    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m a Primary School ICT Technician with over seven years of hands-on experience, passionate about using technology to enrich education and empower both students and teachers. I hold a BSc in Computing and Information Technology from the University of Derby, where I built a strong foundation in problem-solving, systems management, and IT innovation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my current role as an ICT Cluster Technician, I support multiple primary schools by maintaining and enhancing their IT environments. From troubleshooting classroom tech to introducing new tools and streamlining systems, I take pride in making technology reliable, efficient, and accessible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of education, I contribute to <strong>FAForever</strong>, an open-source gaming community project. Collaborating with a global team has sharpened my skills in development, user experience, and community engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm also a proud dad and stepdad to two amazing boys. Whether we’re out on a nature walk or enjoying spontaneous adventures, family time is everything. My fiancée and I also love weekend getaways and cozy cinema nights—it’s all about creating balance and making memories.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether I’m supporting teachers, building home tech projects, or helping improve gaming tools, I’m always exploring meaningful, creative ways to use technology.
