    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m a Primary School ICT Technician with 7+ years of hands-on experience, passionate about using technology to enrich education and empower both students and teachers.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hold a BSc in Computing and Information Technology from the University of Derby, where I built a strong foundation in problem-solving, systems management, and IT innovation.
    </p>
    <p>
      👨‍🏫 <strong>Education-focused</strong> — I support multiple primary schools, maintaining and enhancing their IT environments for reliability and accessibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      🎮 <strong>Community Contributor</strong> — I actively contribute to <strong>FAForever</strong>, an open-source gaming project, collaborating on development, user experience, and community tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      👨‍👩‍👦 <strong>Family First</strong> — Proud dad and stepdad to two boys. We enjoy nature walks, spontaneous adventures, and cozy weekends with cinema nights.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether I’m supporting teachers, building home tech projects, or helping improve gaming tools, I’m always exploring meaningful, creative ways to use technology.
