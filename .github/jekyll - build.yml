      # Restore and accumulate cache to speed up the build process

      # To have responsive image we generate the various images sizes and formats while
      # building the Jekyll website. These are stored in a folder (called cache). With this setup
      # we try to restore the cache and save it in an accumulative manner. The accumulative manner
      # is done via the 'restore-keys' value. It searches for the latest match if the actual
      # key is not found.

      # To prevent lingering images that are no longer used to exist in the cache we automatically
      # add the year to the key. That way each year the cache is generated from scratch and
      # populated with images that we use at that moment.
